Protein Folds are responsible for the 3D structure of protein.  Folds occur due to the interactions of the various R side groups of the amino acids.  Determining how proteins fold and the different folding classes is useful in detecting evolutionary relationships between proteins.  The hope is that if we can determine these evolutionary relationships, then we can predict protein function.  This repository contains various algorithms using spectral analysis to predict the protein folds based on the provided amino acid sequences.
